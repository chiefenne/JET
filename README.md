# JET
Numerical solution of a 2D turbulent hot jet exiting from a nozzle into still atmosphere.

The numerical solution procedure adopts Keller's BOX scheme.

During my master thesis 30 years ago I had to rework the numerical solution procedure and also the software given in the book "Physical and computational aspects of convective heat transfer" by T. Cebeci and P. Bradshaw.

The code was done in FORTRAN 77 and the plotting was performed usinge some BENSON plot library on a VT200 or VT300 series monochrome terminal with graphics capability.

I try now to redo it with modern programming tools like Python and additional Python visualization libraries.
In addition I can improve my IPython skills.

And it makes FUN!
