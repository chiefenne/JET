# JET
Numerical solution of a 2D turbulent hot jet exiting from a nozzle into still atmosphere.

During my master thesis 30 years ago I had to rework the numerical solution procedure and also the software given in the book "Physical and computational aspects of convective heat transfer" by T. Cebeci and P. Bradshaw.

I try now to redo it with modern tools like Jupyther and re-program it with Python and visualization tools.
